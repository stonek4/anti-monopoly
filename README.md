# Anti-Monopoly Simulation

While on vacation, my parents and I picked up a game called Anti-Monopoly, which was clearly a spinoff of the original Monopoly game.  The game (found here: http://www.antimonopoly.com/) uses the basic monopoly rules with some twists, the largest being the two types of players (competitors and monopolists).  Upon playing the game, my parents and I discovered that the game seems to heavily favor monopolists over competitors, and the game also appeared to take longer than normal monopoly (which already takes a long time) to play. The purpose of this simulator is to test different rule sets in order to create a fair rule set that shortens the length of games.

## How to Use
The simulator is a python script, that can be run by downloading the files and running:

`$ python main.py`

There is a lot more that can be configured, and in a while I will update the program with documentation and a config file that will allow for all sorts of madness.
